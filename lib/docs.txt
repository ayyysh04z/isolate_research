In Dart and Flutter, isolates are separate memory-separated instances of the Dart runtime, which means that each isolate runs 
independently of others, utilizing its own memory and CPU resources. When you spawn multiple isolates, they can execute concurrently,
 taking advantage of multi-core processors.

The concurrency of isolates in Dart isn't directly dependent on the number of available threads. Dart uses an event loop model 
where isolates run concurrently but not necessarily in parallel on separate CPU cores. The number of cores and threads that Dart 
can utilize may depend on the underlying system's capabilities and optimizations by the Dart runtime.

If you spawn 10 isolates simultaneously, they can execute concurrently, but the degree of parallelism (how many actually 
run simultaneously) might be influenced by various factors:

CPU Cores: If the underlying hardware has multiple cores, Dart can distribute isolates across these cores, allowing them to run more concurrently.

Scheduler: Dart's scheduler manages isolates and their tasks. The scheduler tries to utilize available resources 
effectively but may also manage how isolates are scheduled and run based on available resources and other factors.

Workload and Blocking Operations: If isolates perform CPU-intensive tasks and the hardware has sufficient cores, 
they might execute simultaneously. However, if the tasks are I/O-bound or involve waiting for external resources 
(network, file system), Dart might switch to other isolates while waiting, thus increasing overall concurrency but not necessarily parallelism.

System Load: The overall system load and resources available can affect how many isolates can effectively run concurrently.

Remember that while Dart isolates provide concurrent execution, how they're scheduled and how many run simultaneously 
may depend on various factors, including the runtime environment, the nature of the workload, and the underlying hardware.
 Therefore, spawning multiple isolates doesn't guarantee a direct one-to-one parallel execution based solely on the number of available threads or cores.
